# Congressional Database Project

Simple database project for my Web/Mobile App Development Class at Ave Maria University as part of the Computer Science Program.

The objective was to create a site that displays data about United States Congressman, which was scraped from votesmart.org and bulkloaded to a PostgreSQL database.

The site uses Django on the backend to manage and interact with the PostgreSQL database.
Remaining simple, the frontend sticks with basic HTML and CSS.
